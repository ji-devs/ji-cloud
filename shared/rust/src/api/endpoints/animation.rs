///
/// 1. User requests an upload session URI directly to Google Cloud Storage
///     a. User uploads to processing bucket
/// 2. Firestore is notified of `processing = true, ready = false` status at document `uploads/media/global/{id}`
/// 3. Animation is processed and uploaded to the final bucket
/// 4. Firestore is notified of `processing = true, ready = true` status at document `uploads/media/global/{id}`
///
/// # Notes:
///
/// * Can be used to update the raw data associated with the animation.
/// * If the client wants to re-upload an image after it has been successfully processed, it must repeat
/// the entire flow instead of uploading to the same session URI.
///
/// Errors:
/// * [`401 - Unauthorized`](http::StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED) if authorization is not valid.
/// * [`403 - Forbidden`](http::StatusCode::FORBIDDEN) if the user does not have sufficient permission to perform the action.
/// * [`501 - NotImplemented`](http::StatusCode::NOT_IMPLEMENTED) when the s3/gcs service is disabled.
