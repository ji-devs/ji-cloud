/// 1. Author/admin creates a player session using [`POST /v1/jig/player`](Create)
///     * This is represented by a *session code/index*
/// 2. Unauthed user instantiates the player session. This creates an instance of a session. [`POST /v1/jig/player/session`](instance::Create) returns:
///     * A short lived token, which identifies the guest user and the session instance.
///     * The player session settings.
///     * `JigId` of the JIG on which the session was created.
/// 3. Unauthed user posts short lived token to complete the instance. [`POST /v1/jig/player/session/complete`](instance::Complete)
///     * This increments the play count of the jig.
///     * Deletes the completed instance from the DB.
///
/// The hierarchy here is Jig -> Player Session -> Session Instance, where each arrow is a one-to-many mapping.

/// Each level is uniquely identified by `JigId` -> `JigPlayerSessionIndex` -> token.
